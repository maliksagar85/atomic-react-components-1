# Atomic React Pattern Lib

A react pattern library with collocation of generic components and equipped with ideal react development ecosystem.

## Why a Component Library?

> **_A component library helps you achieve consistent branding as it becomes the single source of truth for every component not only in the application but for all projects in the organization._**

> **_Instead of duplicating the component code across features in your project, implement the component from a central source, like a component library._**

## Installation and Uses

This package can be used in 2 ways as NPM dependency or as Fork/Clone; if you wish to setup your own component library. Its collection of reusable react components built to serve all type of react based projects to achieve consistent user experience and reusability.

### As NPM Dependency

If you wish to consume components exported by this library as is and don't see much scope for customization, following is how this package can be used:

```sh
yarn add @xt-pagesource/atomic-react-pattern-lib

**or**

npm install @xt-pagesource/atomic-react-pattern-lib
```

To reuse one of the component in your react components just import the components you need. Each component has its un-styled export too as Vanilla version.
For components with Default styles, you need to import base Theme and GlobalStyles. base theme needs to be passed as a prop
to our react components. You may use ThemeProvider from styled-components to pass down Theme prop to every component in the hierarchy
GlobalStyles needs to be initialized before other components as well

```javascript
//1. With Default Styles
import { Button, Theme, GlobalStyles } from '@xt-pagesource/atomic-react-pattern-lib';

<GlobalStyles>
<ThemeProvider theme={Theme}>
  <Button>Test</Button>
</ThemeProvider>

//

//2. Without Default Styles
import { ButtonVanilla } from '@xt-pagesource/atomic-react-pattern-lib';
```

Detailed guidelines to work with this ecosystem are available [here](readme/index.md).

Dependencies should be installed using the **yarn** (Preferred Option).

```sh
yarn install
```
